# Car-LaneLines-P1 - Finding Lane Lines on the Road

Code to identify lane lines on the road, first in an image, and later in a video stream (i.e. a series of images). Including:
- A series of steps (pipeline) that identify and draw the lane lines on a few test images 
- A series of steps (pipeline) that identify and draw the lane lines on  a video stream.
- Pipeline refinement  with parameter tuning and by averaging and extrapolating the lines.
- A brief writeup report based on writeup_template.md.

The given P1_example.mp4 in the repository is an example of what final output should look like.
Two videos are provided for testing are called "solidWhiteRight.mp4" and solidYellowLeft.mp4".
